# How to Write a Good Brag Document

## What is a Brag Document?

A brag document is a running record of your work accomplishments. It helps you:

- **Remember your achievements** when it's time for performance reviews
- **Track your impact** with concrete examples and metrics
- **Communicate your value** to managers, peers, and future employers
- **Recognize patterns** in your work and career growth

The concept was popularized by Julia Evans. Read her excellent blog post: [Get your work recognized: write a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/).

## Tips for Effective Brag Documents

1. **Be specific** - Include numbers, metrics, and concrete outcomes
2. **Write regularly** - Add entries weekly or after significant accomplishments
3. **Focus on impact** - Who benefited? What changed?
4. **Include context** - Why was this important?
5. **Don't be modest** - This is your document to showcase your work

## Example Entry

Here's what a good brag document entry looks like:

```markdown
### Reduced API latency by 40%
- **Topic:** Improve API performance
- **Impact:** Faster response times improved user satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.1
- **Tags:** backend, optimization
```

This entry is effective because it:
- States a specific accomplishment with a metric (40% reduction)

- Includes context through the topic and tags
